## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Considerations**

### **Vercel Security Checkpoint:**
- Production site may show Vercel security checkpoint initially
- This is normal for new deployments and automated access
- Manual browser access should work normally
- Checkpoint typically resolves within 5-10 minutes

### **CDN Cache:**
- Some changes may take 5-15 minutes to propagate globally
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) may be needed to see updates
- Mobile devices may cache longer than desktop

### **Email Templates:**
- Email branding updates are deployed but won't be visible until next email send
- Test email functionality to verify new branding appears correctly
